 * [648] Replace Words
 */

// @lc code=start

// In English vocabulary, there are concept of `root` and `successor` (eg. another = an + other). Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the word in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length. Return the sentence after the replacement. (sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces, with no leading or trailing spaces.)

// "trie api: find the shortest prefix of a word"

func replaceWords(dictionary []string, sentence string) string {

}
